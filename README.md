**This repository contains the source code related to Mixed Reality project, focusing on the Meta Quest 3 and Unreal Engine 5.5**
- This project is a Mixed Reality (MR) app, since it involves room scanning, generating scene geometry from the physical environment, and integrating virtual elements (robot, blocks) into that context within VR. 
- The use of passthrough or spatial mapping to anchor virtual objects in a user's real space aligns with MR, not standard VR alone. 

**How to Use:**
- Clone this repository to your local machine:
- Open the folder Environment_Rotate in Unreal Engine 5.5.
- Build and launch the project in VR preview mode or deploy to Meta Quest 3 for testing.
